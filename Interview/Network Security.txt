Question 1:  Faulty Firewall
Suppose you have a firewall that's supposed to block SSH connections, but instead lets them through. How would you debug it?
Make sure each section of your response answers the questions laid out below.
​


Restate the Problem


Provide a Concrete Example Scenario

In Project 1, did you allow SSH traffic to all of the VMs on your network?
Which VMs did accept SSH connections?
What happens if you try to connect to a VM that does not accept SSH connections? Why?



Explain the Solution Requirements

If one of your Project 1 VMs accepted SSH connections, what would you assume the source of the error is?
Which general configurations would you double-check?
What actions would you take to test that your new configurations are effective?



Explain the Solution Details

Which specific panes in the Azure UI would you look at to investigate the problem?
Which specific configurations and controls would you check?
What would you look for, specifically?
How would you attempt to connect to your VMs to test that your fix is effective?



Identify Advantages/Disadvantages of the Solution


Does your solution guarantee that the Project 1 network is now "immune" to all unauthorized access?


What monitoring controls might you add to ensure that you identify any suspicious authentication attempts?​
